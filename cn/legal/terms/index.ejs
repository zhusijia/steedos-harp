                These Terms of Service (“Terms“) govern your access to and use of SteedOS (“SteedOS”, “we” or “our”) websites, services, and applications (collectively the “Service“). Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.
            </p>
            <p style="height:20px"></p>
            <p><a style="font-size:20.5">Your Use of the Service</a></p>
            <p style="height:20px"></p>
            <p>
                By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization or entity (“Organization”), then you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that Organization and you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind the Organization to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” refers to you and that Organization.
            </p>
            <p style="height:20px"></p>
            <p>
                You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with SteedOS, and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations. The Service may change from time to time as we evolve, refine or add more features to the Service, often without prior notice to you. In addition, SteedOS may temporarily or permanently stop providing the Service, or any features within the Service, to you or to users generally and may not be able to provide you with prior notice.
            </p>

            <p><a style="font-size:20.5">Your Content</a></p>
            <p style="height:20px"></p>
            <p>
                Some areas of the Service allow you to post or upload information, text, graphics, or other material (“Content” or, when posted by you, “your Content”), and to share your Content with others. You retain ownership of your Content, but there are many things that users may do with your Content, for example, copy it, modify it, re-share it, or broadcast it. SteedOS has no responsibility for that activity. You understand that publishing your Content on the Service is not a substitute for registering it with any rights organization. Please consider carefully what you choose to upload.
            </p>
            <p style="height:20px"></p>
            <p>
                You agree not to post Content that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property; (iii) seeks to harm or exploit children by exposing them to inappropriate content, asking for personally identifiable details or otherwise; (iv) may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort; (v) contains any information or content that we deem to be unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, profane, or otherwise objectionable; (vi) contains any information or content that is illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law or of another party’s trade secrets); (vii) contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; or (viii) contains any information or content that you know is not correct and current. You agree that any Content that you post does not and will not violate rights of any kind, including without limitation any intellectual property rights or rights of privacy. We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to reject and/or remove any Content that we believe, in our sole discretion, violates these provisions.
            </p>
            <p style="height:20px"></p>
            <p>
                You retain full ownership to your Content, but you agree to grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, transferable, perpetual, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, edit, translate, make derivatives, display and distribute such Content in connection with providing the Service to you and other users in accordance with your settings on the Service. In connection with providing the Service, we may modify or adapt your Content in order to transmit, display or distribute it over computer networks and in various media and/or make changes to your Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that Content to any requirements or limitations of any networks, devices, services or media.
            </p>
            <p style="height:20px"></p>
            <p>
                We reserve the right at all times, but are not obligated, to remove or refuse to distribute any Content on the Service including your Content. We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce the Terms, including investigation of potential violations, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or safety of SteedOS, its users and the public.

            <p>
                You must provide us accurate information when you create your SteedOS account. Your SteedOS account gives you access to the Services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of users or organizations. If you connect to SteedOS with a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service. You may never use another user’s account without permission.

                You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with SteedOS or a third-party service. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols with your account. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. SteedOS cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements. You must notify SteedOS immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.

                Subject to these Terms, SteedOS gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-sublicensable and non-exclusive license to use the Service.

                We may make available software to access the Service via a mobile device (“Mobile Software”). To use the Mobile Software you must have a mobile device that is compatible with the Mobile Service. We do not warrant that the Mobile Software will be compatible with your mobile device. We give you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use a compiled code copy of the Mobile Software for one account on one mobile device owned or leased solely by you, for your personal use. You may not: (i) modify, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the Mobile Software, except to the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by law; (ii) rent, lease, loan, resell, sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the Mobile Software to any third party or use the Mobile Software to provide time sharing or similar services for any third party; (iii) make any copies of the Mobile Software; (iv) remove, circumvent, disable, damage or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Mobile Software, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content accessible through the Mobile Software, or features that enforce limitations on use of the Mobile Software; or (v) delete the copyright and other proprietary rights notices on the Mobile Software. You agree that we may from time to time issue upgraded versions of the Mobile Software, and may automatically electronically upgrade the version of the Mobile Software that you are using on your mobile device. You agree to the automatic upgrading on your mobile device, and agree that the terms and conditions of these Terms will apply to any upgrades. Any third-party code that may be incorporated in the Mobile Software is covered by the applicable open source or third-party license EULA, if any, authorizing use of such code. This license is not a sale of the Mobile Software or any copy thereof, and SteedOS or its third party partners or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in the Mobile Software (and any copy thereof). We reserve all rights not expressly granted under these Terms.
